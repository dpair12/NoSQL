## Application-Demo

not ready yet

## Installation

To run the application after installing it to your local machine, enter npm i to install all necessary packages. Aftewards, enter npm run seed and then npm start and it should start running the application on PORT 3001.

## Usage

Feel free to use this application for a guide as to how you may want the backend server of a social media application to work.

## No License Used

## Contributing

I am the sole contributor to this application.

## Tests

Creating functions that are assigned to routes for crud operations was the hardest part about this application due to the use of Object Ids. In order to make sure all data was being shared correctly(to the best of my ability), I had to do multiple tests of Schema structures and commands to perform certain functions within MongoDB.
